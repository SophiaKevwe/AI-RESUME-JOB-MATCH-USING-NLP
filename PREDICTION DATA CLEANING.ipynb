bridge since Progress database was not compatible with Java JSP would have the input information and being sent directly to the database JDBC driver for ODBC data source was purchased with the bridge which give the liberty to move the interaction to any other database Responsibilities Code and unit test the JSPs Configure the JDBCODBC driver Implement the 4GL queries required for inserting and updating the information Code the triggers that would replicate the main catalogs into temporary tables Environment JSP JDBCODBC driver Progress Education Bachelor of Science in Computer Systems

       "       'pts I lead architected and help developing the SOLRLucene Search system which was later migrated to Elasticsearch with 15 nodes sharding The system was initially developed and maintained in house but later deployed to AWS cloud and prototyped on Azure The development and test of the 15 node done on VirtualBox machines physical machines before deployment to the Cloud The SOLR development was done in two different phases initially we did indexing directly on top of the metadata extracted from various files with Apache Tika Apache Flume and scoop I wrote a scheduler in Java that run delta indexing periodically every few hours We had customized faceting and then the API would grab the top N results from the XML The search worked better than expected the indexing was slow but the search was extremely fast in fraction of a second On the second phase we stored all the raw documents in HDFS and create indexing and then use HBase to store the index files in HDFS Also an API was developed in JAVA with a NET wrapper with SOLR search calls into the SOLR engine I lead architected and help developing an advanced Machine Learning system initially in Spark MLlib then Weka and ultimately a Mahout Machine learning and recommendation system using both ItemSimilarity and UserNeighborhood I personally favored and created porotypes using Spark MLlib TensorFlow Keras Python libraries like scikitlearn Pandas but in this case Mahout worked very well The NET API would record every time a product was clicked or purchased The data was recorded in the database and then the metadata was created and the mahout would create a scoring table 010 for product and region The NET API would select top N highest score and would present it as recommendations I lead architected

through a JDBC driver for Oracle The application handled various aircraft parts and handled as a CRUD of the upper spec and lower spec limits So all auditors would measure in the manufacturing area

maintained in house but later deployed to AWS cloud and prototyped on Azure The development and test of the 15 node done on VirtualBox machines physical machines before deployment to the Cloud The SOLR development was done in two different phases initially we did indexing directly on top of the metadata extracted from various files with Apache Tika Apache Flume and scoop I wrote a scheduler in Java that run delta indexing periodically every few hours We had customized faceting and then the API would grab the top N results from the XML The search worked better than expected the indexing was slow but the search was extremely fast in fraction of a second On the second phase we stored all the raw documents in HDFS and create indexing and then use HBase to store the index files in HDFS Also an API was developed in JAVA with a NET wrapper with SOLR search calls into the SOLR engine I lead architected and help developing an advanced Machine Learning system initially in Spark MLlib then
